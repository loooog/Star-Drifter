## Testing
Your web browser may not allow you to open this launched directly from your filesystem. You will need to serve this from an HTTP server. If you want to test locally and you have python, then use pip to install SimpleHTTPServer then run it within same directory of index.html and visit "localhost"

```
pip install SimpleHTTPServer
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```
